Writing top notch packages
***
Write a simple (or complex) package for NPM/Yarn or PyPI/PIP. These packages coudl do simple things and be built on top of existing packages like turlte. If you want a list of ideas for this have a look at the [python projects page](./Projects%20for%20python.md)

There is great article on [medium detailing this process](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-a-beautiful-tiny-npm-package-and-publish-it-2881d4307f78).
