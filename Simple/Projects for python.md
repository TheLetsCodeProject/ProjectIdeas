# Python
Projects for mad snakes
***

Simple:
- Snap game
- Encryption system
- Draw pictures from data files using an image library
- Custom file encryption
- Dice roller (implement variable for dice size)
- Password generator
- Team picker (given a variably sized list, pick random teams that are as close to even as possible)
- Sheetsu API

## twitter bot
Make a mad twitter bot which can do sick shit. Maybe it tells the weather on request, generates art or tells a stock price.

## Trump Cards
Create a trump cards game like the greek mythology one you made years ago. This could be done with a number of differerent data sets and could have the graphical card genrated by turtle. A really cool way to this would also to be to use the robohash API which generates avatars based on text inputs. There is ~1200 different images that can get generated.

## String minimiser/Code obfuscator
Write a simple package that obfuscates or minimises code or strings. The package could contain a simple library for manipulating strings or could have a full blown system for refactoring and obfuscating code. The latter option would rely heavily on REGEX.

## API client
There are plenty of free and awesome API's out there just waiting to be used. With these we can make applications that watch stocks, predict weather and gives random number facts. Popular API's include NASA, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, PokeMon and FlightCheck. One example might be to use a celebrity data API to create a game of Celeb-trump cards.

## Monte Carlo simulations
Simulate a variety of probablilty based games such as blackjack. Run a numbers of other simulations such as prisoners dilema or random/short walk problems

## Simple physics simulations
Use basics of physics to calcualte various things

## Online chat room
Use the PubNub API to make a simple chat room.

## Game AI
Write a program to vs other programmers AI in a game of prsioners dilema or others such as blackjack. This requires some cooperation with others as you need to define an interface for this to work

## Neural Nets
whilst the math is extremely complex and takes a long time to learn, implementing a neural network does not actually take all that long.

## Stock trader
Write a simple program to 'trade' stocks using fake currency. See how well you can the program to perform on given stocks. Implement a watchlist system which reads stocks from a file and checks if they meet certain conditons. If they do, buy a calculated amount.

## FitBit reward tracker
use the fitbit APIS to track progress on self set awards and deisplay personally currated stats and graphs
