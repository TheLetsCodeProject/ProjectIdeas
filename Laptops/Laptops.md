### Notes:
Most reviews highlight the fact that the touch screen is kinda unecessary and will probably be better when turned off. 4k limits battery life although its unclear by how much. IO on this machine is really good for an ultrabook (2x USB-A 3.1 Gen 1, 1x USB-C ThunderBolt 3 (40Gbps bi-directional) [HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, USB 3.1 Gen 2, 4 lanes PCIe Gen 3], Native HDMI, Barrel Power, Headphones/Microphone 1/8 inch jack, SD [All types], All have PowerShare). The 4k models have 16GB of RAM instead of 8GB and also have a 512GB SSD, it has been noted that whilst it also has a bigger battery, the 4k screen might balance that out. It is possible to install extra RAM in the 1080p model but that will cost at least $100 anyway, it is a similar deal with the SSD  plus a $250 windows reinstall making the 4k model a safer and possibly better value option. The 4k model also has the potential for scaling issues when using some applications. Because of the higher resolution, the graphics card will, relatively speaking, pack less of a punch.

Both the UHD and FHD screen look super nice however there are a number of key differences. The FHD model features a matte screen and has 98% colour completion. It has pretty good viewing angles with anything up to 45Â° looking nice and sharp. The 4k model features much better viewing angles and has much deeper blacks and higher contrast with 100% colour completion. The 4k model also features a glossy screen which can lead to somewhat noticeable reflection. This should not be too much of a problem as inside use tends to not be affected too much and the XPS can pump out the brightness at 400 nits.
