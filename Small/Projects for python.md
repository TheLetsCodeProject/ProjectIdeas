Simple:
- Snap game
- Encryption system
- Draw pictures from data files using an image library
- Custom file encryption
- Dice roller (implement variable for dice size)
- Password generator
- Team picker (given a variably sized list, pick random teams that are as close to even as possible)

## Monte Carlo simulations
Simulate a variety of probablilty based games such as blackjack. Run a numbers of other simulations such as prisoners dilema or random/short walk problems

## Simple physics simulations
Use basics of physics to calcualte various things

## Online chat room
Use the PubNub API to make a simple chat room.

## Game AI
Write a program to vs other programmers AI in a game of prsioners dilema or others such as blackjack. This requires some cooperation with others as you need to define an interface for this to work

## Neural Nets
whilst the math is extremely complex and takes a long time to learn, implementing a neural network does not actually take all that long.

## Stock trader
Write a simple program to 'trade' stocks using fake currency. See how well you can the program to perform on given stocks. Implement a watchlist system which reads stocks from a file and checks if they meet certain conditons. If they do, buy a calculated amount.
