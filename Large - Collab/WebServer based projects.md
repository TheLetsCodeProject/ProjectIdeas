Here are short collection of projects involving a variety of server based apps.

## But is it fruit
A small webapp to answer the age old debate. Is it fruit?
This project could be done in a number of ways including Wix Code or a custom digital ocean deploy.

## Smart Lyric generator
A web site which gives you a clever lyric from a famous artist. This could also respond to queries for certain artists and genres and allow for user contribution. This would simply deploy from a digital ocean droplet and access an Amazon web services Dynamo database.

## Scoreboard and username API
A score board and username API for unity. This could be from a numbers of different appraoches. Each with varying difficulty and credibilty. The easiest is to write a .NET wrapper for PubNub or Dreamlo. The harder would be to deploy a custom REST API on Node or a service worker for an online database system.
